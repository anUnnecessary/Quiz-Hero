    <div class="accordion mt-5" id="accordionPanelsStayOpenExample">
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <h2 class="accordion-header" id="panelsStayOpen-headingOne">
            <button class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#panelsStayOpen-collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="panelsStayOpen-collapseOne">
                What is the difference between map(),filter(),find(),forEach()?

                map() creates a new array by transforming each element of the original array, filter() creates a new array by selecting elements that meet a certain condition, find() returns the first element that meets a certain condition, and forEach() applies a function to each element of the array without returning anything.

                Local storage, Session storage, and Cookies - are mechanisms provided by modern web browsers to store data on the client-side. However, they differ in the way they store data and their intended use cases.
                In summary, Local storage is used for storing persistent data, Session storage is used for storing temporary data that is cleared when the browser is closed, and Cookies are used for maintaining user state, preferences, and tracking user activity.

              <div class="accordion-body">
                The event loop is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows the language to support asynchronous programming. It is responsible for managing the execution of code, including timers, I/O operations, and event handlers, in a non-blocking way.
                By using this mechanism, the event loop ensures that JavaScript code can execute asynchronously without blocking the main thread of the browser, allowing for a more responsive and performant user experience.
